## Terms & Definitions

- **accuracy**: %ge of correct predictions (ratio of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) to the total predictions)
- **continued pre-training**: provide unlabeled data to FM to improve domain knowledge
- **cross-validation**: data preparation technique for model training
- **embeddings**: numerical representations of words
- **few-shot learning**: make predictions using a few examples in prompt
- **foundational model (FM)**: broader then LLM, can handle various data types
- **hallucination**: false information generated by LLM
- **image_uri**: Docker image URI in Amazon SageMaker AI
- **inference_instances**: list of inference instances for a model deployed in Amazon SageMaker AI
- **instruction-based fine-tuning**: use labeled examples (prompt, response pairs) to improve FM on a specific task
- **knowledge cutoff**: data limitaion due to LLMs pre-trained on static datasets
- **large language model (LLM)**: focus on text & language tasks
- **mean absolute error (MAE)**: mean of the absolute differences between the actual values and the predicted values
- **mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)**: mean of the absolute differences between the actual values and the predicted values, divided by the actual values
- **prompt engineering**: optimize FM inputs to generate better responses
- **prompt template**: predefined format to standardize inputs and outputs
- **recall**: metric to measures true positives (TP)
- **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**: technique to let LLM use information from external knowledge base
- **S3 bucket policy**: grants access to S3 data
- **semi-supervised learning**: combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is useful to train models to recognize different driving scenarios that might not be fully labeled.
- **supervised learning**: train models on labeled data to recognize and classify objects
- **temperature**: control randomnes of response (higher temperature -> more random)
- **top K**: # of most-likely candidates considered for next token.
- **top P**: %ge of most-likely candidates considered for next token
- **unsupervised learning**: detect anomalies or unusual patterns
- **zero-shot learning**: make predictions without examples
